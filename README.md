## Hello üëã, I am [Ayan Das](https://ayandas.me) (@dasayan05)

------

I am a Ph.D. student at [SketchX Lab](http://sketchx.ai/), [University of Surrey](http://surrey.ac.uk/) working in the field of Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. My focus is on analysing and modelling human sketches and drawings from a computational as well as theretical perspective. Also interested in human congnition and its computational models.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Me in a nutshell:

- **Love programming:** `C/C++`, `Python` for daily job & `Lisp`, `Julia`, Web Technologies (moderate-level) for fun.
- **Fond of Math:** Daily research work involves lot of maths like Linear Algebra, Probabilities and Optimization.
- **Love to teach:** Eager to share knowledge; publish full-fledged (comprehensive) [blogs/articles](https://ayandas.me/blogs.html) on various research topics.
- **Extra:** Love Music, Foods and Animals (specially Cats).
